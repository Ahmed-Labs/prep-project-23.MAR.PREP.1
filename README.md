# MLH Prep Project

Over the next 2 weeks, you'll be building a React App that works with various APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that talk to different data sources to do cool stuff.

## API services used
We're using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/current) to get weather data on different cities. Your challenge over the next 2 weeks is to build out this website and add even more functionality to it. At the moment, it displays basic information about a location when you type it in. Check out [Issues](/issues) for some more ideas!

We're using the [HERE Location Services](https://platform.here.com/) for the autocompletion feature in the search bar. The API provides location autocomplete suggestions and search results based on the user input.

To use the API, you need to sign up for a free account and obtain an API key. The API key should be kept secure and not shared with anyone.

To integrate the API into the project, you will need to make HTTP requests to the API endpoint, passing in the user input and the API key. Please refer to the [HERE API documentation](https://developer.here.com/documentation) for more information on how to use the API.

You'll need to get your own API Key from their website (for free) and add it as an environment variable in a `.env` file. We have a template available as `example.env`.

You'll be using React initially to build this. If you're new to React, check out the [website](https://reactjs.org) for some information on getting started!
